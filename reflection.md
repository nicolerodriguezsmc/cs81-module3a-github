Reflection Prompts (REFLECTION.md)

* What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?

I learned that you can use the terminal to make changes to your online GitHub account. I've only used Github online without the terminal, so that was interesting to try for the first time.

* What was most confusing or frustrating?

The most confusing part was figuring out how to log out of my old GitHub account and push changes to the new GitHub account I made for this class. I ended up creating a SSH authentication key to make it easy.


* Why do you think developers use Git?

I think developers use Git as a way to collaborate on the same code. Additionally, to track changes and versions in case there is an issue with an update.

* How might this help with larger projects in the future?

This will help with larger projects in the future by making it easy to track changes. There have been many times when I've broken my own code but did not have the foresight to save an older version of the code that did mostly work.
